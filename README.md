# Word-Guess-Game
Assignment #3
https://dstark88.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/

The goal of this project is to make a hangman style game. This was my very first assignment for the coding bootcamp. This was also our first solo try at dynamically producing items on the html page. I found it hardest to get the underscore to dynamically populate depending on how long the computers chosen word was. Even with all the things I would like to work on I was very proud of how my first assignment turned out. 

As future work I would fix a few of the bugs. The biggest issue I had was when I had a word with two of the same letters I couldnâ€™t get it to count the second letter. With only a week to do my first assignment I chose a work around by changing all the words to not have a duplicate letter. 
Also remove the alert so that you could see the last letter added. 
Then I would add a pause the the game before moving on to the next word. 
Also I would not count against the person playing for using the same letter twice.
